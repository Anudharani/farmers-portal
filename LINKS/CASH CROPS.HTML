        <p>A cash crop or profit crop is an agricultural crop which is grown to sell for profit.
            It is typically purchased by parties separate from a farm. 
            The term is used to differentiate marketed crops from subsistence crops,
            which are those fed to the producer's own livestock or grown as food for the producer's family.
            In earlier times cash crops were usually only a small (but vital) part of a farm's total yield,
            while today, especially in developed countries and among smallholders almost all crops are mainly
            grown for revenue. In the least developed countries, cash crops are usually crops which attract 
            demand in more developed nations, and hence have some export value.</p>
    <h1>SUGARCANE</h1> 
    <img src="C:\Users\Ram\Desktop\AGRI\Images\sugarcane.jpg"  >
    <li type="square">
        Sugarcane or sugar cane refer to several species and hybrids of tall perennial
         grass in the genus Saccharum, tribe Andropogoneae, that are used for sugar production. 
    </li><br>
    <li type="square">
        The plants are two to six metres (six to twenty feet) tall with stout, jointed, fibrous stalks
         that are rich in sucrose, which accumulates in the stalk internodes.
       </li><br>
       <li type="square">
          Sugarcanes belong to the grass family, Poaceae, an economically important flowering plant family
           that includes maize, wheat, rice, and sorghum, and many forage crops. 
       </li><br>
       <li type="square">
           It is native to the warm temperate to tropical regions of India, Southeast Asia and New Guinea.
       </li><br>
       <li type="square">
           Sugarcane is the world's largest crop by production quantity, with 1.8 billion tonnes
        produced in 2017, with Brazil accounting for 40% of the world total.
        </li><br>
        <li type="square">
         In 2012, the Food and Agriculture Organization estimated it was cultivated on about 26 million hectares (64 million acres) in more than 90 countries.
        </li><br>
        <li type="square">
          About 70% of the sugar produced globally comes from a species of sugarcane called Saccharum officinarum 
            and hybrids of this species.All sugarcane species can interbreed, and the major commercial cultivars are complex hybrids.

        <h1>COTTON</h1>
        <img src="C:\Users\Ram\Desktop\AGRI\Images\cotton.jpg">
        <li type="square">
         Cotton is a soft, fluffy staple fiber that grows in a boll, or protective case, around the seeds of the 
       cotton plants of the genus Gossypium in the mallow family Malvaceae. 
        </li><br>
        <li type="square">
           The fiber is almost pure cellulose. Under natural conditions, the cotton bolls will increase the dispersal of the seeds.
        </li><br>
       <li type="square">
           The plant is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions around the world, including the Americas, Africa, Egypt and India. The greatest diversity of wild cotton species is found in Mexico, followed by Australia and Africa.
       </li><br>
       <li type ="square">
        Current estimates for world production are about 25 million tonnes or 110 million bales annually, 
        accounting for 2.5% of the world's arable land.
       </li><br>
       <li type="square">
        India is the world's largest producer of cotton.The United States has been the largest exporter for many years.
       </li><br>
       <li type="square">
           In the United States, cotton is usually measured in bales, which measure approximately 0.48 cubic meters 
          (17 cubic feet) and weigh 226.8 kilograms (500 pounds)

<h1>JUTE</h1>
<img src="C:\Users\Ram\Desktop\AGRI\Images\jute.jpg">
<br>
<li type="square">
    Jute is a long, soft, shiny bast fiber that can be spun into coarse, strong threads.
     It is produced from flowering plants in the genus Corchorus, which is in the mallow family Malvaceae. 
</li><br>
<li type="square">
     The primary source of the fiber is Corchorus olitorius, but it is considered inferior to Corchorus capsularis.
      "Jute" is the name of the plant or fiber used to make burlap, hessian or gunny cloth.
</li><br>
<li type="square">
Jute is one of the most affordable natural fibers, and second only to cotton in the amount produced and variety of uses. 
</li><br>
<li type="square">
Jute fibers are composed primarily of the plant materials cellulose and lignin. It falls into the bast fiber category  along with kenaf, industrial hemp, flax (linen), ramie, etc.
</li><br>
<li type="square">
The industrial term for jute fiber is raw jute. The fibers are off-white to brown, and 1–4 metres (3–13 feet) long. 
Jute is also called the "golden fiber" for its color and high cash value.
