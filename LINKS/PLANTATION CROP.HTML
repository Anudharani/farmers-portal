        A plantation is a large-scale estate, generally centered on a plantation house, meant for farming that specializes in cash crops.
         The crops that are grown include cotton, coffee, tea, cocoa, rubber trees and forest trees.
          Protectionist policies and natural comparative advantage have sometimes contributed to determining where plantations are located.

        Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species. 
    </li><br>
    <li type="square">
        When coffee berries turn from green to bright red in color – indicating ripeness – they are picked, processed, and dried.
    </li><br>
    <li type ="square">
        Dried coffee seeds (referred to as "beans") are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor.

    <li type="square"> 
        Roasted beans are ground and then brewed with near-boiling water to produce the beverage known as coffee.

    <li type="square">
        Tea is an aromatic beverage commonly prepared by pouring hot or boiling water over cured or fresh leaves
         of the Camellia sinensis, an evergreen shrub native to East Asia.
    </li><br>
    <li type="square">
          After water, it is the most widely consumed drink in the world.
          There are many different types of tea; some, like Darjeeling and Chinese greens, have a cooling, slightly
           bitter, and astringent flavour,
         while others have vastly different profiles that include sweet, nutty, floral, or grassy notes. 
    </li><br>
    <li type="square">
         Tea has a stimulating effect in humans primarily by its caffeine content.

          Tea originated in the region encompassing today's Northeast India, north Myanmar, Southwest China and Tibet,
                where it was used as a medicinal drink by various ethnic groups in the region.
    </li><br>
    <li type="square">
      An early credible record of tea drinking dates to the 3rd century AD, in a medical text written by Hua Tuo.
      It was popularised as a recreational drink during the Chinese Tang dynasty, and tea drinking spread to other East Asian countries.

    <h1>RUBBER</h1>
    <img src="C:\Users\Ram\Desktop\AGRI\Images\rubber.jpg">
    <li type="square">
        Natural rubber, also called India rubber, latex, Amazonian rubber, caucho or caoutchouc, as initially
         produced, consists of polymers of the organic compound isoprene, with minor impurities of other organic compounds, plus water. 
    </li><br>
    <li type="square">   
         Thailand and Indonesia are two of the leading rubber producers. 
         Types of polyisoprene that are used as natural rubbers are classified as elastomers.
    </li><br>
    <li type="square">
          Currently, rubber is harvested mainly in the form of the latex from the rubber tree or others.
       The latex is a sticky, milky colloid drawn off by making incisions in the bark and collecting the fluid in 
        vessels in a process called "tapping".
    </li><br>
    <li type="square"> 
        The latex then is refined into rubber that is ready for commercial processing. 
        In major areas, latex is allowed to coagulate in the collection cup. The coagulated lumps are collected and processed into dry forms for sale.
