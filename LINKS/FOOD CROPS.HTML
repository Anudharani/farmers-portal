         <h2>WHEAT</h2>
         <img src="C:\Users\Ram\Desktop\AGRI\Images\wheat.jpg">
         <li type="square">
                Wheat is a grass widely cultivated for its seed, a cereal grain which is a worldwide staple food.
            The many species of wheat together make up the genus Triticum; 
            the most widely grown is common wheat (T. aestivum).
         </li><br>
        
         <li type="square">
            Botanically, the wheat kernel is a type of fruit called a caryopsis.
         </li><br>

         <li type="square"> 
            Wheat is grown on more land area than any other food crop (220.4 million hectares, 2014).
             World trade in wheat is greater than for all other crops combined.
         </li><br>

         <li type="square">
            Wheat is an important source of carbohydrates.Globally, it is the leading source of vegetable
             protein in human food, having a protein content of about 13%, which is relatively high compared to
              other major cereals but relatively low in protein quality for supplying essential amino acids.
         </li> <br>

         <li type="square">
            When eaten as the whole grain, wheat is a source of multiple nutrients and dietary fiber.
         </li><br>

         <li type="square">
            In a small part of the general population, gluten â€“ the major part of wheat protein
            can trigger coeliac disease, noncoeliac gluten sensitivity, gluten ataxia, and dermatitis herpetiformis.

<h1>MAIZE</h1>
<img src="C:\Users\Ram\Desktop\AGRI\Images\maize.jpg">
     <li type="square">
       Maize, also known as corn, is a cereal grain first domesticated by indigenous peoples in southern Mexico about 10,000 years ago.
    </li><br>

    <li type="square">
       The leafy stalk of the plant produces pollen inflorescences and separate ovuliferous inflorescences called ears that yield kernels or seeds, which are fruits.
    </li><br>

    <li type="square">
        Maize has become a staple food in many parts of the world, with the total production of maize surpassing that of wheat or rice.
    </li><br>

    <li type="square"> In addition to being consumed directly by humans (often in the form of masa),maize is also used for corn ethanol, animal feed and other maize products, such as corn starch and corn syrup.
    </li><br>

    <li type="square">
        The six major types of maize are dent corn, flint corn, pod corn, popcorn, flour corn, and sweet corn.
     </li><br>

     <li type="square">
     Sugar-rich varieties called sweet corn are usually grown for human consumption as kernels, while field corn varieties are used for animal feed, various corn-based human food uses, and as chemical feedstocks.
      Maize is also used in making ethanol and other biofuels.

<h1>MILLETS</h1>

<img src="C:\Users\Ram\Desktop\AGRI\Images\millet.jpg">
<li type="square">
    Millets  are a group of highly variable small-seeded grasses, widely grown around the world as cereal crops 
    or grains for fodder and human food.
</li><br>    

<li type="square">
Millets are important crops in the semiarid tropics of Asia and Africa (especially in India, Mali, Nigeria, and Niger),
 with 97% of millet production in developing countries.
</li><br>

<li type="square">
 The crop is favored due to its productivity and short growing season under dry, high-temperature conditions.
</li><br>

<li type="square">
Millets are indigenous to many parts of the world.
The most widely grown millet is pearl millet, which is an important crop in India and parts of Africa.
</li><br>

<li type="square">
Finger millet, proso millet, and foxtail millet are also important crop species.
Millets may have been consumed by humans for about 7,000 years and potentially had "a pivotal role in the rise of multi-crop agriculture and settled farming societies.

<h1>PULSES</h1>
<img src="C:\Users\Ram\Desktop\AGRI\Images\pulses.jpg">
<br>
<li type="square">
    PULSES are annual leguminous crops yielding from one to 12 grains or seeds of variable size, shape and 
    colour within a pod. They are used for both food and feed.
</li><br>
<li type="square">
The term "pulses" is limited to crops harvested solely for dry grain, thereby excludingcrops
 harvested green for food (green peas, green beans, etc.) which are classified as vegetable crops. 
</li><br>
<li type="square">
 Also excluded are those crops used mainly for oil extraction (e.g.soybeand and groundnuts) 
 and leguminous crops (e.g. seeds of clover and alfalfa) that are used exclusively for sowing purposes.
</li><br>
<li type="square">
In addition to their food value, pulses also play an important role in cropping systems because of their
 ability to produce nitrogen and thereby enrich the soil. Pulses contain carbohydrates, mainly starches 
 (55-65 percent of the total weight); proteins, including essential amino acids (18-25 percent, and much 
 higher than cereals); and fat (1 - 4 percent).
</li><br>
<li type="square">
 The remainder consists of water and inedible substances.
Only two processed products are included in the FAO list, namely flour of pulses and bran of pulses.
