        <p>Horticulture is the agriculture of plants, mainly for food, materials, comfort and beauty for decoration.
           Horticulturists apply knowledge, skills, and technologies to grow intensively produced plants for 
           human food and non-food uses and for personal or social needs. Their work involves plant propagation 
           and cultivation with the aim of improving plant growth, yields, quality, nutritional value and 
           resistance to insects, diseases and environmental stresses. They work as gardeners, growers, therapists, designers, 
            and technical advisors in the food and non-food sectors of horticulture.</p><br>

        <h1>FRUITS</h1>

            Fruits are the means by which angiosperms disseminate seeds. Edible fruits, in particular, 
            have propagated with the movements of humans and animals in a symbiotic relationship as a means for 
            seed dispersal and nutrition.
        </li><br>
        <li type="square">   
            In fact, humans and many animals have become dependent on fruits as a source of food.
            Accordingly, fruits account for a substantial fraction of the world's agricultural output, 
            and some have acquired extensive cultural and symbolic meanings.
        </li><br>
        <li type="square">
            In common language usage, "fruit" normally means the fleshy seed-associated structures of a plant that
              are sweet or sour, and edible in the raw state, such as apples, bananas, grapes, lemons, oranges, and strawberries. 
        </li><br>
        <li type="square">
          On the other hand, in botanical usage, "fruit" includes many structures that are not commonly 
         called "fruits", such as bean pods, corn kernels, tomatoes, and wheat grains.</li><br>

<h1>VEGETABLES</h1>
<img src="C:\Users\Ram\Desktop\AGRI\Images\vegetable.jpg">
<li type="square">
    Vegetables are parts of plants that are consumed by humans or other animals as food.
     The original meaning is still commonly used and is applied to plants collectively to refer to all
      edible plant matter, including the flowers, fruits, stems, leaves, roots, and seeds.
</li><br>
<li type="square"> 
      The alternate definition of the term is applied somewhat arbitrarily, often by culinary and cultural tradition. 
</li><br>
<li type="square">     
       It may exclude foods derived from some plants that are fruits, flowers, nuts, and cereal grains, but include savoury
     fruits such as tomatoes and courgettes, flowers such as broccoli, and seeds such as pulses.
</li><br>
<li type ="square">
    Vegetables can be eaten either raw or cooked and play an important role in human nutrition,
     being mostly low in fat and carbohydrates, but high in vitamins, minerals and dietary fiber.
     </li><br>
     <li type="square">
      Many nutritionists encourage people to consume plenty of fruit and vegetables, five or more portions a day often being recommended.
